                        <p>Korean artist <b>Kim Jung Gi</b> was born in 1975 in the town of Goyang-Si, located in the province of Kyongki-Do South Korea. At 19, this budding artist enrolled at a Fine Arts School, majoring in Art and Design. He attended Dong-Eui University in Busan for three years and did his two years in the South Korean army as a part of the Special Forces Unit. Here, he was able to memorize the array of different weapons and vehicles.
                            <br><br>
                            Kim’s most notable creative asset is his <b>memory</b>, something he has developed over a number of years. His ability to render extremely complicated scenes near-perfectly from <b>memory</b>, without the aid of references, has stretched the boundaries of what many artists believed was possible.
                            <br><br>
                            Kim Jung Gi’s first publication – <b>Funny Funny</b> – was published in Young Jump magazine. He wrote a number of short stories and held exhibitions for his work that led to his teaching <b>manhwa</b> (Korean comic book) to various private schools and universities. Kim collaborated with Seung-Jin Park, the writer of <b>Tiger the Long Tail</b>, to draw six volumes for his comic. Kim also worked alongside French author Bernard Werber, illustrating two novels he had written – “<b>Paradise</b>” in 2010 and “<b>Third Humanity</b>” in 2013.
                            <br><br>
                            In 2011, Kim Jung Gi partook in the <b>Comic Festival</b> held in Bucheon where, for the first time ever, he drew live. In most cases, artists showcase a framed drawing or painting, but KJG decided to do something different. He placed paper up on three walls around his table and began drawing.
                            <br><br>
                            Superani CEO Hyun Jin Kim videoed and posted the entire process on <b>YouTube</b> and, as some videos tend to do, went viral. This led to the invitation to different worldwide events. In recent years, he has accepted invitations to perform in <b>France</b>, <b>America</b>, all around <b>Asia</b> and now in <b>Japan</b> for his first show simply titled “<b>Drawing Exhibition</b>”.
                            <br><br>
                            Kim has six <b>sketchbooks</b> in print, which equate to about <b>4,500 pages</b>’ worth of drawings in a span of 12 years. He also collaborated with the legendary Japanese artist Katsuya Terada in 2017. The pair put together an amazing <b>sketchbook</b> of various drawings, showing off their talents.
                            <br><br>
                            He’s worked in various industries – <b>movies</b>, <b>music</b>, and <b>government</b>. Kim put together a feature exhibition in <b>Cheongwadae</b>” the Republic of Korea’s president’s official workplace and residence. He was also hired by Korean Hip-Hop artist Drunken Tiger to create the <b>album cover</b>.
                            <br><br>
                            He holds the record for “<b>Longest drawing by an individual</b>” in the <b>Guinness World Records</b> book. He died on October 3, 2022, in Villepinte, France.</p>
